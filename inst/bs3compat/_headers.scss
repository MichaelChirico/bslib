// BS3 -> BS4 saw a removal of margin-top on headers,

  // For BS5+, only apply the margin-top if pandoc's CSS classes
  // are present. This way rmarkdown::html_document_base will continue
  // to have margin-top (which is good), but 'raw' headers won't, which
  // leads to a better experience with accordions, popovers, etc
  // (their design/examples expect headers that don't have margin-top).
  // It also seems as though Quarto docs don't generate these CSS classes,
  // but it also seems they've added their own rules https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/0e662c/src/resources/formats/html/bootstrap/_bootstrap-rules.scss#L595-L613
